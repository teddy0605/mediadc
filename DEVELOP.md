# MediaDC — Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
./dev-setup.sh
```

This destroys any existing dev container and creates a fresh one:
- MariaDB 11 + Nextcloud 33 at http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin)
- MediaDC app mounted from local directory
- Python 3.13 + pip + ffmpeg + all Python deps installed
- Pre-compiled binary auto-downloaded on app enable
- File scanner run

## Development Workflow

### After changing PHP code

Restart Apache so the web server picks up changes (OPcache):

```bash
docker exec nextcloud-dev apache2ctl graceful
```

### After changing Python code

Clear bytecode cache — Python caches `.pyc` files and the mounted volume
shares them between host and container:

```bash
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
```

### After changing frontend code (src/)

```bash
npm run build          # production build
npm run watch          # or watch mode for development
```

### Checking logs

```bash
# Nextcloud PHP log
docker exec -u www-data nextcloud-dev php occ log:tail

# Python task execution log
docker exec nextcloud-dev cat $(docker exec nextcloud-dev find /var/www/html/data -path '*/mediadc/logs/output.log' 2>/dev/null)
```

### Re-enabling the app (triggers migration steps)

```bash
docker exec -u www-data nextcloud-dev php occ app:disable mediadc
docker exec -u www-data nextcloud-dev php occ app:enable mediadc
```

### Creating a release (triggers binary build)

```bash
gh release create v0.X.0 --title "v0.X.0" --notes "Release notes"
```

GitHub Actions builds PyInstaller binaries for x86_64 and aarch64 and
attaches them to the release.

## What Works

- [x] App installs and enables on NC 33 with MariaDB
- [x] Vue 3 frontend with @nextcloud/vue 9
- [x] Admin settings page (toggles, system info)
- [x] Task creation from MediaDC UI
- [x] Task creation from Files app ("Scan for duplicates" on folders)
- [x] Python task execution (image hashing, duplicate detection)
- [x] Task completion and results display
- [x] Pre-compiled binary download on install (fallback to system Python)
- [x] CI pipeline for building binaries on release
- [x] No cloud_py_api dependency

## Known Issues

None currently.

## Remaining Work

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Update dev tooling**: phpunit ^9.5 -> ^10.x, psalm ^5.15 -> latest
- [ ] **Update psalm baseline**: New files (PythonService, PythonUtilsService)
      aren't in the psalm baseline.
- [ ] **Update issue template**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` still
      references cloud_py_api.

### Future

- [ ] **AppAPI migration**: Convert Python scripts to a Docker-based ExApp
      using nc_py_api as a FastAPI service. Removes need for exec() and host
      Python. This is the Nextcloud-recommended approach for non-PHP backends.

## Architecture Notes

### cloud_py_api removal

The original app depended on the `cloud_py_api` Nextcloud app for Python execution.
We replaced it with two local services:
- `lib/Service/PythonService.php` — executes Python via `exec()`/`nohup env`
- `lib/Service/PythonUtilsService.php` — system detection, binary download, env helpers

PHP passes `NC_*` environment variables (dbtype, datadirectory, dbtableprefix, etc.)
so nc-py-api can find the database without calling `occ`.

### Pre-compiled binaries

PyInstaller bundles `main.py` + all Python dependencies into a single ~70MB
executable per platform. Built via GitHub Actions on each release.

On app install/update, the migration step downloads the binary from the GitHub
release. If download fails, `python_binary` is set to `false` and the app falls
back to running `main.py` with system Python (requires python3, pip, ffmpeg).

Binary path: `{datadir}/appdata_{instanceid}/mediadc/binaries/mediadc_{platform}/main`
